#### Project uses JS, HTML, CSS to create a simple web app/page which plays sounds when clicking via mouse/touch or pressing keyboard buttons. Drumkit includes tom, hihat, openhat, kick drum, ride, snare, tink, clap and boom sounds. 

Simple and fun to mess around with.

#### Instructions

1. `git clone https://github.com/usarneme/jsdrumkit`
2. `cd jsdrumkit`
3. Spin up a server using your preferred method to serve this folder, eg: `python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`
4. Visit in your browser localhost:8080

#### Try it out

There's a built version already available [here](http://js-drumkit.surge.sh/)

#### Potential Issues

1. Doesn't deal with concurrent playing very well. You can play more than one sound at a time but it quickly breaks down when trying to press 3+ sounds simultaneously. 
2. Too simple?
3. No way to record audio/playback what you've created
